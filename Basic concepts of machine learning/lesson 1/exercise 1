# Answer in writing what is a model and what is a machine learning model.

A model is a specification of mathematical relationship that exists between different variables.
For instance, if you're going to write a cookbook recipe, you might build a model (likely in a spreadsheet)
that takes inputs like "number of eaters" and "hungriness" to quantities of ingredients needed.
The recipe model is probably based on trial and error - someone went in a kitchen
and tried different combinations of ingredients until they found one they liked.
Models are created using a formal language, such that mathematic notation, programming language.
Models are created to obtain knowledges about the modeled system.
Studying the model gives knowledge about the original system.


A machine learning model is an aggregate of computer program and array of parameters (are mere computer variables).
The model has inputs where the information from the domain of interest is fed and outputs where the prediction appears.
The predictions are done after processing inputs by a model computer program using parameters.
While the computer program is often standard, the values of parameters are specially tuned in the course of training.
The parameters are the most precious part of the model. Their number is usually large and they are kept in files in external memory.
While predictions are done by the model itself, its training requires additional software.
It can be standard or written by a data scientist for the particular task.
