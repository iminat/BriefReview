# Write brief descriptions of three types of model learning

There are 3 types of model learning: unsupervised models, supervised models, reinforcement models.
Supervised learning: In supervised learning, the model is trained on a labeled dataset, where each data record
is accompanied by a desired output.
During training, the input is passed to the model and it produces an output that is compared to the desired output.
The difference between the two is used to correct the model parameters.
The goal of supervised learning is to extract and store the essential features of the data as model parameters,
so that the model can produce a correct output for new inputs it has never seen before.

Unsupervised learning: In unsupervised learning, the model is trained on unlabeled data,
where no known output data is given to the model. The purpose of unsupervised learning is to detect patterns from data,
such as identifying groups of similar examples within the data (data clustering) or estimating the distribution
of the data based on a certain law (density estimation or parametric learning).
Unsupervised learning is useful when the desired output is not known or is difficult to obtain.

Reinforcement learning: In reinforcement learning, the model interacts with a dynamic environment that sends it inputs,
and the model responds with outputs. The difference from supervised learning is that the exact desired output is unknown
and the model receives feedback in the form of rewards and punishments based on its actions.
The goal of reinforcement learning is to train the model to make decisions that maximize the reward over time.
Reinforcement learning is used in tasks such as training a robot to navigate a maze or teaching a virtual agent
to complete a task in a simulated environment.
