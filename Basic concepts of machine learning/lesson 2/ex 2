#Describe in writing the ways of fighting with overfitting and underfitting.

Overfitting and underfitting are two common problems that can occur when training machine learning models.
Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers,
leading to poor performance on new, unseen data.
Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when a model is too simple and cannot capture the underlying patterns in the
data, resulting in poor performance both on the training data and on new data.

There are several ways to combat overfitting and underfitting:
Regularization: Regularization techniques add a penalty term to the loss function of the model to discourage complex
models and favor simpler ones. L1 regularization, L2 regularization, and dropout are common regularization techniques.

Cross-validation: Cross-validation is a technique to evaluate a model's performance on multiple splits of the data.
By using multiple train-test splits, we can obtain a more accurate estimate of the model's performance on new data.

Early stopping: Early stopping is a technique to stop the training process early when the model starts to overfit.
We monitor the model's performance on a validation set and stop the training when the validation loss stops improving.

Data augmentation: Data augmentation is a technique to generate new training data from the existing data by applying
various transformations such as rotation, scaling, and flipping.
This helps to increase the diversity of the training data and reduces overfitting.

Feature selection: Feature selection is a technique to select the most relevant features from the data to reduce
the complexity of the model and prevent overfitting.

Ensembling: Ensembling is a technique to combine multiple models to improve the overall performance.
By combining the predictions of multiple models, we can reduce the variance and improve the generalization performance.

Overall, the choice of a specific technique to combat overfitting or underfitting depends on the problem at hand,
the complexity of the data, and the size of the dataset. A combination of multiple techniques may be required for
optimal performance.
