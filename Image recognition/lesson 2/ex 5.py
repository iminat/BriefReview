# Describe in writing why pooling is necessary after convolution.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successful in image classification, object detection, and other computer
vision tasks. In CNNs, convolutional layers are used to extract features from the input image.
However, the feature maps produced by the convolutional layers can be large and contain redundant information.
Pooling is applied to the feature maps to address this issue.

Pooling is a process that reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps by down-sampling them.
This is achieved by dividing the feature maps into non-overlapping regions, and replacing each region with a single
value. The most common pooling technique is max pooling, which selects the maximum value in each region. Other pooling
techniques include average pooling and L2 pooling.

Pooling is necessary after convolution because it reduces the computational complexity of the network and makes it more
efficient. It also helps to reduce the effect of small translations in the input image, making the network more robust.
Additionally, pooling helps to prevent overfitting by forcing the network to learn more generalizable features that
are invariant to small changes in the input.
