# Describe in writing why dropout layer are not recommended after convolutional layers.

Dropout layers may not be recommended after convolutional layers in neural networks, as dropout can lead to the loss of
important local features, slowing down the training process, and having minimal regularization effect on convolutional layers.

However, dropout can still be used in neural networks with both convolutional and fully connected
layers if used carefully, and can be applied after the fully connected layers, which are more prone to overfitting.
