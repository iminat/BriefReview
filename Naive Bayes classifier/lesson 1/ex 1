# Describe in writing what an assumption is made when a naive Bayes classifier is created. Why the classifier is naive?

When creating a naive Bayes classifier, one of the main assumptions made is that the features used to describe the data
are conditionally independent given the class. In other words, the probability of observing a particular combination of
features is assumed to be the product of the probabilities of each individual feature, given the class.
This assumption is sometimes called the "naive" assumption because it is a simplification of reality.
In many real-world scenarios, the features used to describe the data are not actually independent given the class.
For example, in a spam detection task, the presence of certain words may be correlated with the presence of other words.
However, despite this simplification, naive Bayes classifiers can often perform surprisingly well in practice.
The reason why the classifier is called "naive" is because it makes this strong assumption of conditional independence,
which may not hold in reality. However, this simplification allows for a very efficient and effective method for
classification, and the approach is widely used in many applications, including text classification, sentiment analysis,
and image recognition.
