# Describe in writing what means maximum likelihood?

Maximum likelihood is a statistical method used to estimate the parameters of a probability distribution based on
a set of observed data. The basic idea is to find the values of the parameters that maximize the likelihood of observing
the data that we have. The likelihood is the probability of observing the data given a set of parameter values.
In other words, it is the probability of obtaining the data we have,
assuming that the distribution is specified by the parameter values we are interested in.
To find the maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters, we typically use an optimization algorithm
to find the values that maximize the likelihood function. This involves taking the derivative of the likelihood function
with respect to each parameter and setting them equal to zero to find the values that maximize the function.
