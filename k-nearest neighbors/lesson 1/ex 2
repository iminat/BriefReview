# Describe how to deal with ties when more then one class appear in the neighborhood with identical frequencies.

When considering more then one neighbors, they vote to assign a label.
This means that it is counted how many neighbors belong to each class. The new point is assigned a more frequent label.
Assume that and there are 2 classes.
For a given data point the model have found neighbors with the following classes: (0, 0, 1).
In this case the point will be labeled as belonging to the class 0.
Assume however that we consider and 3 classes.
It is possible that among the neighbors two different classes will appear twice: The neighbors can be like this (0,0,1,1,2).
What class to choose, 0 or 1?
Such situations are called ties.

Their resolution depend on the implementation of the kNN model. There are several options:
Pick the first met class in a list of neighbors as the winner.
Pick one of the winners at random.
Weight the votes by distance and pick the weighted winner.
Reduce k until we find a unique winner.
